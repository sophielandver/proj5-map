# proj5-map
A map that is initially centered on Eugene, Oregon. When the user clicks (or taps on a mobile device), a 
marker is created at that location. In open state the marker displays the address of the location; else 
the marker simply looks like a map pin. In addition, markers for a configurable set of points of interest 
are placed on the map. The POI are in a textfile called POI.txt.
